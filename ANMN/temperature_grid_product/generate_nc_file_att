file_version_quality_control = Derived products require scientific and technical interpretation. Normally these will be defined by the community that collects or utilises the data.
lineage                      = The following steps have been carried out to generate this product:\n1- Only Temperature and Depth data with QC flags 0, 1 and 2 (non QC'd, good and probably good data) from FV01 files are considered.\n2- Every single time-series data collected at different nominal depths has had their data binned temporally (with a bin size of 60 minutes). The timestamp given to an averaged value sits in the centre of its bin.\n3- For every temporal bins previously defined, averaged values are then linearly interpolated over a consistent 1m resolution vertical grid. Vertical interpolation occurs between two nearest available averaged data and when they are not available a fillvalue is given.
