   'rm -rf [ProgramLocationDestination];   svn export  https://svn.emii.org.au/repos/SOOP_CURRENT_JOB/trunk/ [ProgramLocationDestination]
2. Open config.txt to change the location of :
-script.path :location of the scripts (from the checkout)
-python.path :location of the python binary
-matlab.path :location of the matlab binary
-df.path	 :location of the datafabric(or cloud storage)
-dataSOOP.path:location of the SOOP scripts output (log + data)

Issue ID	Summary

== Tips ==
In order to move the software folders localy to a virtual machine through SSH, here are the following steps
# to do localy
tar cfz - /var/lib/matlab_2_DATA/SOOP | ssh lbesnard@emii3-vm2.its.utas.edu.au "tar zxvf - -C ~/IMPORT"


# to do on the VM as lbesnard user for SOOP, on a shell type :
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/matlab_2_DATA/SOOP
sudo mv ~/IMPORT/var/lib/matlab_2_DATA/SOOP /var/lib/matlab_2_DATA/SOOP
sudo chown matlab_2:matlab_2 -R /var/lib/matlab_2_DATA/


#If we want to add/update the scripts with a newer version
# to update SOOP from svn, as matlab_2, on a shell type :
#(content of the script rm -rf /usr/local/bin/SOOP/SOOP_TRV_RSS_MATLAB_CODE;   svn export  https://svn.emii.org.au/repos/SOOP_aims_CURRENT_JOB/trunk/SOOP_RSS_MATLAB_CODE  /usr/local/bin/SOOP/SOOP_TRV_RSS_MATLAB_CODE)
UPDATE_SVN_SOOP.sh


# to create a link usable by anyuser, as root do
sudo ln -s /usr/local/harvesters/matlab_2/svn/SOOP/SOOP_RSS_MATLAB_CODE/SOOP.sh  /usr/local/bin/SOOP_AIMS_Download


# in matlab_2 bashrc, we should have this following line:
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/bin/:~/scripts/ 


# in order to use the command as matlab_2 , symply type:
SOOP_AIMS_Download
