Convert pulse8.nc from IMOS 1.3  to OceanSITES 1.2


Questions for OceanSITES:

* Is there a format checker for v1.2?

* When is the next revision due?

* Parameter dictionary available on GDAC ftp servers?

* What's the correct value of the Conventions attribute? Which version of CF is OceanSITES 1.2 based on?


(( comments on manual v1.3 draft
* missing parameter names

Questions for Tom/Pete:

* What quality_control_indicator value should we use? (ref table 2.1)

* Does Pulse have a WMO code?

* PRES variables have name="Water pressure in Bar",  but units="dBar". Which is it? Let's make them consistent.
