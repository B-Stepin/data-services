== Installation ==
1. Copy the folder "SOOP_Aggregation" or checkout the last subversion byt typing in you shell :
   'rm -rf [ProgramLocationDestination];   svn export  https://svn.emii.org.au/repos/AggregationDataSet/trunk/ [ProgramLocationDestination]

2. Open config.txt  to modify if necessary :
-AGGREGAdataSOOP.path	:the folder where data will be downloaded and processed :requires lots of space, 20 GB is comfortable
-df.path		:the DataFabric location, mount with webdav
-aggregationType	:a string 'month' or 'year' to define the type of aggregation we want
-SOOPStation.code		:any station to aggregate can be added here.

optional if code does not work
				3.add in your matlab javapath (could be in startup.m)
				javaaddpath('[ProgramLocationDestination]/SOOP_Aggregation_MATLAB/myJavaClasses/toolsUI-4.2.jar')
				javaaddpath('[ProgramLocationDestination]/SOOP_Aggregation_MATLAB/myJavaClasses/postgresql-9.1-902.jdbc4.jar')

4. Create a link of AggregateSOOP.sh to /usr/bin/ by executing in you shell 
sudo ln -s /[ProgramLocation]/AggregateSOOP.sh /usr/local/bin/AggregateSOOP

5. Execute the program by typing in your shell 'AggregateSOOP'

Issue ID	Summary


== Tips ==
In order to move the software folders localy to a virtual machine through SSH, here are the following steps
# to do localy
tar cfz - /var/lib/matlab_2_DATA/SOOP/Aggregation_DATA | ssh lbesnard@emii3-vm2.its.utas.edu.au "tar zxvf - -C ~/IMPORT"

# to do on the VM as matlab_2 user for SOOP, on a shell type :
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/matlab_2_DATA/SOOP/Aggregation_DATA
sudo mv ~/IMPORT/var/lib/matlab_2_DATA/SOOP/Aggregation_DATA /var/lib/matlab_2_DATA/SOOP/Aggregation_DATA
sudo chown matlab_2:matlab_2 -R /var/lib/matlab_2_DATA/


If we want to add/update the scripts with a newer version
# to update SOOP from svn, as matlab_2, on a shell type :
UPDATE_SVN_SOOP_aggregation.sh 		#(content of the script rm -rf /usr/local/bin/SOOP/SOOP_Aggregation_MATLAB;   svn export  https://svn.emii.org.au/repos/SOOP_AggregationDataSet/branches/v1.1.3/ /usr/local/bin/SOOP/SOOP_Aggregation_MATLAB)

# to create a link usable by anyuser, as root do
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/SOOP/SOOP_Aggregation_MATLABAggregateSOOP.sh  /usr/local/bin/SOOP_aggregation

# in matlab_2 bashrc, we should have this following line:
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/bin/:~/scripts/ 

# in order to use the command as matlab_2 , symply type:
SOOP_aggregation
