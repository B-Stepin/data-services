== Installation ==
1. Clone the folder "faimms_data_rss_channels_process_matlab" by typing in you shell :
   'rm -rf [ProgramLocationDestination];   git clone https://github.com/aodn/data-services/edit/master/FAIMMS/faimms_data_rss_channels_process_matlab/ [ProgramLocationDestination]
2. Open config.txt to change the location of :
-script.path :location of the scripts 
-python.path :location of the python binary
-matlab.path :location of the matlab binary
-dataOpendapRsync.path	 :location of the datafabric(or cloud storage)
-dataWIP.path:location of the FAIMMS scripts output (log + data)
-logFile.name:name of the log file
-email1.log	 :email to send to the first user (for each current job)
-email2.log  :email to send to the second user (for each current job) - NOT REQUIRED
3. Create a link of FAIMMS.sh to /usr/bin/ by executing in you shell 
sudo ln -s /[ProgramLocation]/FAIMMS.sh /usr/local/bin/FAIMMS_AIMS_Download
4. chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass in command line and write down the password for the table such as 
localhost:5432:maplayers:user:password
5. install the python module  from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/configobj/ . 1 wget *zip, unzip *.zip, python setup.py install
6. Execute the program by typing in your shell 'FAIMMS_AIMS_Download'

== Tips ==
In order to move the software folders localy to a virtual machine through SSH, here are the following steps
# to do localy
tar cfz - /var/lib/matlab_2_DATA/FAIMMS | ssh lbesnard@emii3-vm2.its.utas.edu.au "tar zxvf - -C ~/IMPORT"


# to do on the VM as lbesnard user for FAIMMS, on a shell type :
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/matlab_2_DATA/FAIMMS
sudo mv ~/IMPORT/var/lib/matlab_2_DATA/FAIMMS /var/lib/matlab_2_DATA/FAIMMS
sudo chown matlab_2:matlab_2 -R /var/lib/matlab_2_DATA/


#If we want to add/update the scripts with a newer version
# to update FAIMMS or NRS from svn, as matlab_2, on a shell type :
UPDATE_SVN_FAIMMS.sh 		#(content of the script rm -rf /usr/local/bin/FAIMMS/FAIMMS_RSS_MATLAB_CODE/
;   svn export  https://svn.emii.org.au/repos/FAIMMS_CURRENT_JOB/trunk/FAIMMS_RSS_MATLAB_CODE /usr/local/bin/FAIMMS/FAIMMS_RSS_MATLAB_CODE)


# to create a link usable by anyuser, as root do
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/FAIMMS/FAIMMS_RSS_MATLAB_CODE/FAIMMS.sh  /usr/local/bin/FAIMMS_AIMS_Download


# in matlab_2 bashrc, we should have this following line:
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/bin/:~/scripts/ 


# in order to use the command as matlab_2 , symply type:
FAIMMS_AIMS_Download
