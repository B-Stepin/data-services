1;1;0;No QC performed;The level at which all data enter the working archive. They have not yet been quality controlled
2;1;1;Good data;Top quality data in which no malfunctions have been identified and all real features have been verified during the quality control process
3;1;2;Probably good data;Good data in which some features (probably real) are present but these are unconfirmed. Code 2 data are also data in which minor malfunctions may be present but these errors are small and/or can be successfully corrected without seriously affecting the overall quality of the data. 
4;1;3;Bad data that are potentially correctable;Suspect data in which unusual,, and probably erroneous features are observed 
5;1;4;Bad data;Obviously erroneous values are observed 
6;1;5;Value changed;Altered by a QC Centre,, with original values (before the change) preserved in the history record of the profile. eMII discourage the use of this flag. Where data values must be changed (e.g. smoothing of data sets) we strongly prefer that the original data be retained and an additional variable be added to accommodate the interpolated/corrected data values.
7;1;6;Not used;Flag 6 is reserved for future use 
8;1;7;Not used;Flag 7 is reserved for future use 
9;1;8;Interpolated value;Indicates that data values are interpolated 
10;1;9;Missing value;Indicates that the element is missing 
11;2;0;No QC performed;
12;2;1;Good data;The adjusted value is statiscally consistent and a statistical error estimate is supplied 
13;2;2;Probably good data;Probably good data 
14;2;3;Bad data that are potentially correctable;Argo QC tests (15,, 16 or 17,, see Carval et al 2008) failed and all other real- time QC tests passed. These data are not to be used without scientific correction. A flag 3 may be assigned by an operator during additional visual QC for bad data that may be corrected in delayed mode 
15;2;4;Bad data;Data have failed one or more of the real-time QC tests,, excluding T est 16 (see Carval et al 2008). A flag 4 may be assigned by an operator during additional visual QC for bad data that are not correctable
