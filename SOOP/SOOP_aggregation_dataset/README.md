# SOOP_Aggregation

## History
Depreciated scripts to aggregate SOOP files using TOOLSUI java application.

Created at the time of the broken DataFabric, thredds servers holding different datasets ...

It Would take some work to relaunch the program. Useful only for the creation of __NCML__ files, as well as the __performAggregationFromList__ matlab script to aggregate files from a NCML file.
